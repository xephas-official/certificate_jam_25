# Flutter Study Jams 2025 Certificates Repository

Welcome to the official repository for certificates awarded during the Flutter Study Jams 2025, Lead by [Mugisa Brian Cephas](xephas.me) and organized by GDG on Campus Makerere University.

## About Flutter Study Jams 2025

The Flutter Study Jams 2025 was an engaging 3-day informative series of Flutter trainings conducted from 2nd - 4th April 2025. The event was designed to help participants learn and master Flutter, a powerful UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The sessions covered the basics of Flutter, advanced techniques for building complex apps, and much more. We encourage you to explore the resources and videos shared in the [study_jams_25 repository](https://github.com/xephas-official/study_jam_25) to enhance your Flutter skills.
